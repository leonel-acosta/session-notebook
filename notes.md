### notes on branches and PR

When working on a project, especially as a team, you want to work on features independently, so they never affect anyone else's work. Git offers us branches to keep our current work away from a teams common codebase until completion.

A branch lets you split from the main line of development. The new branch shares a part of its commit history with the main branch. At a certain commit the new branch branches off and the commit histories differ.
